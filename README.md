# MagnonDispRels
Example scripts for finding magnon dispersion relations numerically

For finding magnon dispersion relations, the time-and space dependent magntization direction must is saved and evaluated using a Fourier transform.

Examples provided here are gnereated micromagnetically with BORIS
